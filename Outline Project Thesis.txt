Preface

Introduction

Background

- Data with high level of discreteness where a two-sided p-value is wanted
- Genome-wide studies ?
- other examples ? Binary experiements ?
- Problems with ad-hoc choice of p-values

Theory

- Define a valid p-value
-- Note on how our discussion will be centered on two-sided p-values and thus it is not important with the supremum trick
- Introduce the different methods to be used
- The testobservator method
-- NB: Explain the names of the different methods
- Show an example of ad-hoc choice for p-values leading to an invalid p-value.

Method

- Doing arbitrary simulations
-- Binomial distributions
-- Hypergeometric distribution
-- Etc.

- Doing some proofs

Results

- Explanation double tail being strictly dominated by the tail-observator method
- Some plots for general cases
- "Unrobustness" in some cases where the value is a lot lower on one side while being higher on the other side for tail and point methods.
- distance to mean method is very bad in very skewed distributions

Discussion


-- can we show symmetric unrobustness to be a repeated issue for tail and point ? How can we measure the unrobustness of a method ? 
-- How do we eliminate unrobustness ?

Conclusion

- Double tail is bad and should not be used in discrete-cases.
- ??
